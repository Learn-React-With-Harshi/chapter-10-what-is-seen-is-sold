## Build a Food Ordering App - Chapter-10 features

### Configure Tailwind and try to build your whole app using tailwind.

## <ans> Steps : </ans>

### 1. Install tailwindcss

Install tailwindcss via npm, and tailwind.config.js file will be created on executing init commonad.

```
npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init
```

### 2. Configure template paths 

Add the paths to all of your template files in your tailwind.config.js file.
```
module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{html,js}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

### 3. Add the Tailwind directives to your CSS
Add the @tailwind directives for each of Tailwindâ€™s layers to your main CSS file.

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

### 4. Remove all the existing css classes from index.css 

Since we are going to use tailwind css, we can remove all the existing css that we kept writing all these chapters. It might be very painful to see all your efforts to write css these many days go nothing in seconds. But, thats the beauty of learning. Now, we can start making the app look like before using tailwind.

### 5. Start small, don't panic 

I initally had lot of hesitation to use tailwind css. What helped me going was to start with one component at a time. Started in the order of Component hierarchy -
  AppLayout -> Header (its children) -> Body (its children) -> Footer -> Shimmer -> (its children) -> About (its children) -> Login 

### 6. What helped ? 
Since I created the previous versions with plain native css (no framework), it was easy to remove and replace it with tailwind css framework.


<ans>Done :</ans>

1. Web version of UI 
2. Tried to bring the same look as earlier
3. Replaced the previous styles with utility classes of tailwind (not so efficient for now)
4. Tried to reuse few styles for button, card, container, etc
5. Responsiveness for mobile
